### the road to home

I realized I haven't fully explained to anyone what my streaming idea (and now a reality) is when I've been talking about the 3ds capture and the GB operator.

#### I want to play all the pokemon games that I already own, one of every generation, with actual hardware or the carts: and transfer them all the way up to pokemon home.

I am missing games like black and white 2 and ultra sun and moon, but I still count games from the generation as fine. The initial push for this was that I thought that when the 3ds e-shop is going to go down, that pokemon bank would be stranded. It turns out that's not the case, but my idea was to transfer from the earliest available point and bring them into the current system. I feel like this kind of transfer is really interesting and precious about the history of games. It wasn't as easy as moving memory cards and files over, even though .pkmn files are so tiny. The idea of streaming it all is also a walk through pretty much my mostly self-aware life. I played pokemon blue under 10 years old, and then all generation but one I have gotten a game in and played. Some captured me, some did not, but I liked parts about all of them. Playing them again and getting through it with more understanding and an older eye really appeals to me.
\(For various reasons I've restarted those games often, and moved all my childhood pokemon up, so I'm not having to rewrite over the original saves.\)

I was going to start with emerald, with a 2ds capture so I can get gameboy advanced games, but I was shown that there was something called the [GB Operator](https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator). This would allow me to both start from blue and gold with an added feature of being able to save and load .sav files. This means a few things: I can use tools to recreate my blue and gold pokemon and insert them into emerald to transfer up. It also means that I am able to alter the .sav files to give myself access to event pokemon like jirachi. For the DS games I do have an action replay lying around! I'm sure I could figure out some way to do that. Nothing for the 3DS, but that's fine.

For gold the battery has run dry, so I will pretty much just be playing the cart in formality only. I can play the game, save my save as a file, and then load it back up when I access the cart again. The cart itself will not remember anything. The only really bad thing is that you can't save the data until you shut off the emulator, so manual game saves during this time will not actually save the game while playing. If I want to do longer sessions I might have to pause and save the data every once in a while.

So that's the event! I could maybe think of some stream goals to try and hit, but I really am just doing this for me.
